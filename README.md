# Memory Game
This game was completed as a part of my group video game coding project in MATLAB.
The game works by generating sixteen random cards in pairs, with user's goal being to find all the card pairs.
When the user clicks on one of the cards in a 4x4 grid, that card is revealed, then the user needs to find the pair for that card.
If the user finds the pair, both cards disapear. If the user fails to do so, then the cards are flipped back over after a brief moment.
The usermust use their memory in order to find where all the matching pairs are, and once they make all the cards in the grid disapear, they win.
