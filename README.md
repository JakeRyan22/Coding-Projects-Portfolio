# Mine Sweeper Game
This game was completed as a part of my video game coding project in MATLAB.
Mine Sweeper works by generating a grid of bomb and safe tiles, giving values to each tile based on how many bombs are next to them.
The user has to figure out where the bombs are located with this information, while only being able to reveal a single tile or clump of tiles at a time.
The user can flag where they think a bomb is located, helping them avoid revealing those tiles by mistake. The user wins once every non bomb tile is revealed.
The time it takes the user to complete the game is tracked, and the goal is to win as fast as possible. All files need to be in the current folder to run this game through the Minesweeper_Main file in MATLAB.
